A Linux system is divided into three main parts:

- Hardware - This includes all the hardware that your system runs on as well as memory, CPU, disks, etc.
- Linux Kernel - As we discussed above, the kernel is the core of the operating system. It manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with the system.
- User Space - This is where users like yourself will be directly interacting with the system.
